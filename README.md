# MemoryGame

### Author

### Description of the Application
The game is available in German and English. First, the user picks thier preferred language. After that, the user can choose the amount of cards and the game-mode they want to play with. It is possible to play with color-cards or to choose photos from the users filesystem. The photos will automatically be resized and cropped to fit the memory-cards.

### How to install the Application
Simply download the Memory.jar-file and run it. You might need **Java 12** to run it properly.

### What is the Purpose of the Application?
The Memory Game was meant as a repetition of the material I learned in my distant learning course (Java-Programmer SGD).
